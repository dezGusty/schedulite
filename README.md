# Schedulite

A simple scheduler for light tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è The sample tasks are file copy operations with some replacements. To do something more than copying files, you would need to code and add that behaviour yourself.

## Features

- configuration of tasks via a json file
- option to run task at application startup if time to cron job exceeds a configurable value
- monitoring and live reloading of the configuration file
- task config file and logger config file can be loaded either from current working directory or from running binary location.
- file name replacements with custom formatting.

## Configuration

The list of tasks to run is configured via a json file.
While most fields are straightforward, the frequency is defined according to the UNIX cron format

## Running the application

### Standalone

### As a Windows Service

You will require another rust crate named Shawl, which will act as a wrapper for the schedulite app.

## Misc

### Running tasks in emergency mode

The json configuration file allows the specification of a field `run_at_startup_if_next_run_gt_s`.
Values:

- 0: disabled
- [Number] (E.g. 210) Amount of time in seconds
  - if time to the next execution is larget than this value, execute the task immediately

For instance, if the task is configured as in the following json

```json
{
    "task_type": "MoveFile",
    "frequency_cron_config": "0 */10 * * * *",
    "name": "Task 3 (10m)",
    "run_at_startup_if_next_run_gt_s": 210,
    "source_file": "./data/sample-input-3.txt",
    "destination_file": "./data/sample-output-3.txt",
    "enabled": true
},
```

Assuming the app is started 100 seconds after the previous cron interval (E.g. 10:01:40) and 500 seconds before the next cron interval (E.g. 10:10:00), the task should also execute (supplementary) at startup.

```mermaid
timeline

title Start app with 10 minute task 100 seconds after scheduled run

T-100s  : time of previous cron execution
T       : "schedulite" application start
        : 500s > 210s => üèÉ run job now
T+500s  : time of next cron execution 
        : üèÉrun job (regular execution)

```

The same configuration shall not lead to the task being executed supplementary at startup if the start time is a

```mermaid
timeline

title Start app with 10 minute task 520 seconds after scheduled run

T-520s  : time of previous cron execution
T       : "schedulite" application start
        : 80s < 210s => does not run job at startup.
T+80s  : time of next cron execution 
        : üèÉrun job (regular execution)

```

### (Code) impact of delay

- what happens (how the lib treats the time if skipped) if there are one or more tasks between thread sleeps, without hitting the exact match?
main loop:

```rust
loop {
        scheduler.tick();

        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(30000)); // <--30 seconds delay
    }
```

- E.g. task1: "frequency_cron_config": `17 * * * * *`, => every minute at HH:MM:17
- E.g. task2: "frequency_cron_config": `*/10 * * * * *`, => every 10 seconds

main loop:

```rust
loop {
        scheduler.tick();

        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(30000)); // <--30 seconds delay
    }
```

The task1 shall execute once per minute, once the time elapses.
The task2 shall execute twice per minute (due to the large delay of 30seconds, which exceeds the 10seconds frequency).

However, if the sleep duration is larger than the interval.

- E.g. task1: "frequency_cron_config": `17 * * * * *`, => every minute at HH:MM:17
- E.g. task2: "frequency_cron_config": `*/10 * * * * *`, => every 10 seconds

## File copy

The file copy operation is provided as an example of a simple operation.

Nothing special is configured for the file attributes, so tt shall use the default behaviour for copying files.
What it does allow is using some placeholders for variables.

| Variable | Will be replaced with |
| :--- | :--- |
| :{DD} | Day of month (2 digits) |
| :{MM} | Month number (2 digits)
| :{YYYY} | Year (4 digits) |
| :{HH} | Current hour (2 digits) |
| :{mm} | Current minutes (2 digits) |

## TODOs

- allow integration as Windows service.
